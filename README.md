## Project Motivation

This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program.

I have used Seattle Airbnb Dataset for this project which is available at kaggle. This dataset describes the listing activities of homestays in Seattle, WA. The orijinal dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle

**This project focuses on answering following questions:**

- What are the most common amenities in the listings?
- What attracts the guests most for renting a property? 
- What are the most influencial features of the dataset to estimate the price of a listing? 
- What is the impact of listings' proximity to Seattle Downtown in terms of price?
